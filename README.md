<h1> Water Assistant </h1>
<p> Water assistant is a working prototype of a proposed IoT solution to monitor and reduce indoors water consumption </p>
<p>In the real case The system requires metering equipment in each household that connects to the main pipe of the house. 
The metering equipment will calculate the water consumption with a digital sensor which will provide digital data to be shared wirelesslyto the main receiver for processing and analysis. The digital meter will be placed at each main distribution such as pipe to kitchen, bathroom, laundry room and garden or garage to measure the water consumption in specific area of usage.</p>
<p> Knowing the specific amount of water consumption at each point, the system compares data with average general household and provide suggestion for improvements. The user is be able to monitor the water consumption of each area and recieves the notifications or suggestions on his smartphone. </p>
